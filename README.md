# CaesarCipherTool 🔐

A simple Python program that performs **Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption**.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions.

## 💻 How It Works

1. You choose to either **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**.
2. Input your message.
3. Enter a shift number (e.g., 3).
4. The program will output the encrypted or decrypted message.

## 🔧 Example

If the message is `HELLO` and the shift is `3`, the encrypted message will be `KHOOR`.
